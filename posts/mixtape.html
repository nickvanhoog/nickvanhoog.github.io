	<p>Over the last few years there have been an increasing number of releases by artists labeled as "mixtapes". But what is a mixtape? Let's look at some examples:
	<ul>
		<li><b>&&&&& by Arca</b> - Comprised of a solitary 25 minute title track, this mixtape came on the heels of some successful collaborations with FKA Twigs. Arca has two "official" EPs titled Stretch 1 and 2, which are both fairly long at 19 and 27 minutes respectively. But Arca's mixtape is his biggest statement as an artist thus far. This was a release on Hippos In Tanks, and only saw release as free mp3.</li>
		<li><b>House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence by The Weeknd</b> - Where were you the first time you heard Wicked Games? It wasn't so long ago that The Weeknd had an air of mystery, and a friend of mine was messing with shadowy images of the frontman to try and reveal his face. Contrast that with the cover of his first album, on which crooner Abel Tesfaye is featured prominently and clearly, not to mention a recent feature on Ariana Grande's second album. All of these were released for free online, but were later repackaged into a paid triple album.</li>
		<li><b>Late Nights with Jeremih by Jeremih</b> - I (and likely many others) learned of this mixtape because of the Shlohmo remix of Fuck You All The Time. That Jeremih used the mixtape format still surprises me. It was released for free online, independently.</li>
		<li><b>Cut 4 Me by Kelela</b> - The symbiotic relationship between vocalists and producers has reached its final form: beats provided to a vocalist that were subsidized with a prominent advertisement in the track title. This was released for free online via Fade to Mind, Kingdom's Night Slugs offshoot.</li>
		<li><b>nostalgia, ULTRA. by Frank Ocean</b> - This was Ocean's breakout release, and was released via Odd Future as a free download from their website (a common form of release by the OF crew).</li>
		<li><b>pbvsgr.com mixtape by Panda Bear</b> - Released out of the blue by Panda Bear on his website, pbvsgr.com. It streams in your browser and is not downloadable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These releases vary in a few key dimensions. Their track formats include single tracks, album-like traditional track lists, and streaming audio on a website. Some of them were backed by labels, and others were released independently.</p>
	<p>All of these releases were released online for free, but that characteristic alone isn't enough to make a mixtape. At Apple's September 2014 press event, U2 announced the free release of their latest album on iTunes, giving it away to some 500 million people.</p>
	<p>For sure, there is no formal definition of a mixtape. A release is designated a mixtape when the artist declares it as such, or if there is simply no formal designation announced by an authority like a label or the artist. But what has the music community been settling on? As more and more mixtapes are released, what will be their statistical average? We are in the early stages of finding that out.</p>
	<p>To me, a mixtape serves as practice for upcoming releases. It is a bullet point on an artist's musical resume, which is more important for aspiring artists than established ones. There is no pressure on a mixtape, allowing artists to experiment without the pressure of financial success.</p>
	<p>One question lingers. If the ultimate goal is to secure a record deal, does that make the mixtape even more "corrupt" than a label-backed, official release? In some cases the funding of a label can give the artist reason to experiment wildly knowing that the studio time is already promised; see Talk Talk's famous yearlong Spirit Of Eden recording sessions. But that is the exception, not the norm. Typically an album is given to predictable artists, because promising to fund an album is an investment in that album's success. A talent scout for a record label is simply searching for the highest rate of return. Risky artists, like Death Grips, get dropped. As much as I'd like to believe that a label's primary function is the curation and sponsorship of music, vinyl pressing isn't free, and a label must make money in order to continue producing.</p>
	<p>It will be interesting to see how the format is used in the future by established artists. Panda Bear's experiment indicates that artists with existing fanbases that could go through normal label channels to put out a release are interested in trying out new release formats. Just as the consumption of music has gone through fundamental changes since the advent of the Internet and smartphones, the pre-existing notions of what constitutes a release will be upended over time. Making music in your bedroom has never been easier, cheaper, or more legitimate. I look forward to what that will bring.</p>
