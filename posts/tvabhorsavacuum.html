    <h1>TV Abhors a Vacuum</h1>

    <h2>Why has television (TV) become a cornerstone of my conversations?</h2>

    <p>Recently it occurred to me that my casual conversations often touch on TV.</p>

    <p>The appeal of TV to conversation is obvious. Its foremost quality is its ubiquity among Americans. According to the first hit of a single Google search I did on American TV viewing rates, we watched an astonishing 293 minutes of it per day in 2013. That is just shy of five hours. Taking into account the everyday tasks of grooming, cooking, exercising, eating, commuting, working, raising children, and socializing, it is apparent that the average American spends the vast majority of his leisure time consuming TV. It is therefore somewhat of a peculiarity if a person claims they do not watch TV in any form, neither cable on a living room television set nor Netflix while lying in bed. These people are outliers. When considering all other leisure activities, be it rock climbing or The Fifth Element fan fiction or painting, it is obvious that TV is the safest thing to talk about if your goal is finding some common ground with someone else.</p>

    <p>The probability that a given American watches some TV makes it a potent weapon against the anathema of all conversation: awkward silence. Any painful lull in the exchange of words can be reversed by mentioning the latest edge-of-your-seat premiere or finale, of which American content creators ensure a perpetual supply. TV networks schedule their lineup with the same business sense as movie studios, which plan movie release dates around those of their competitors'; release an action movie the same weekend as the new Avengers movie and you deserve to be fired. Combined with the plethora of content sources, it is virtually guaranteed that any average TV viewer will either be actively watching or eagerly anticipating some show. This technique of using TV as a panacea for conversational silence is especially effective if you have already sussed out some traits of the other's personality, giving you a heuristic for choosing which program in your viewing history to broach.</p>

    <p>Related to that last point is a trait not unique to TV. TV is a litmus test for someone's personality. How a person spends his leisure time is indicative of traits like personality, socioeconomic class, and education. Consider two people with equal amount of leisure time, and that one consistently watches the American average of five hours per day, and the other a mere thirty minutes. It stands to reason that the latter individual fills his leisure time with something other than TV. This means the two place unequal value on consuming TV, a quality that I measure in a person. Aside from the time spent watching it, the content a person chooses to view during their TV time is equally important. I would gamble that a fan of The Wire is more concerned with America's incarceration rate than a fan of The Voice. The belief that TV habits are somewhat emblematic of personality, typically left unacknowledged, is powerful. It might drive a person to employ it when deciding if another shares one's values.</p>

    <p>As a congregant of the Church of <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/exhausted-noam-chomsky-just-going-to-try-and-enjoy,17404/">Noam Chomsky</a>, I am instructed to disdain the practice of blankly staring at a rectangle. I have interpreted my deity's feelings about <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1992----02.htm">sports</a> to apply equally to TV: it gives us something to occupy our minds, is of no importance, and takes up precious free time that should be spent doing something more productive. This view, taken to an extreme, is something I have yet to practice, as I watch a modest amount of TV via online distributors like Netflix and Amazon. But I am acutely cognizant of what I am doing, and feel depressed and resentful of myself any time I spend an extended period binge-watching a TV show on my couch. It is telling that the word "binging" has come to describe the TV-viewing habits of many Americans. I believe that most people never fully consider alternatives to the coma-inducing allure of spending their leisure time watching TV. A sorry state of affairs. I dislike watching TV as a way to spend free time because it is easy. It's easy like listening to music from the radio and seeing movies you see on billboards. When we opt for what is easy, we surrender our minds to those who provide that ease. If our tastes define a part of us, and if we are not discriminating and inquisitive in our tastes, then our selves are like auctioned lumps of clay waiting to be molded by the highest bidder.</p>

    <p>Even if you abstain from broaching the subject, TV intrudes upon your life. Friends and devotees cheerfully chirp about plot twists and impending season premieres. This frenzy feeds itself as topics and hashtags begin to "trend" and reap the benefit of the inherent network effects of social media. As a function of the public mindshare the content of social media is a quick way to get a glimpse into people's minds. And this digital proliferation of TV in the public's conscious thought is matched in the physical realm, as interest online bleeds from News Feeds to backyard barbecues.</p>

    <p>Why TV, and not other media like books? Aside from my most cerebral friends, people with whom I converse are more preoccupied with the latest revelations in Game of Thrones than with the nuances of David Foster Wallace's output. I believe this is mostly due to the mental effort required to read a book versus that required to consume TV. Additionally, TV is extremely entertaining; there is no denying that the content being produced by modern creators is superb. Taking a data-first-hypothesis-second, "rational consumer" view of human behavior suggests to me that most people are driven by some algorithm that seeks to minimize effort and maximize pleasure. We revere those who sacrifice their well-being or leisure time to advance noble causes because the average person in rich countries tends to put selfish pleasure over working in a Sisyphean manner against the powerful forces of society. TV fills a voyeuristic void, demonstrated by the fact that one of the most successful programs of all time is titled "Friends", a "so subtle it's obvious" wink at the show's replacement of time spent in the company of other human beings.</p>

    <p>Our ability to resist the allure of TV is being wittled down. Content providers are getting better at tailoring their offerings to consumers in the age of big data. Netflix famously claimed that its decision to produce the popular series House of Cards was influenced by analysis of data gathered about its users. Additionally, the quality of content has increased dramatically as technology has improved. Thus it is no wonder that we are becoming more and more obsessed with TV content. As content creators gather more data about viewers, and algorithms become fancier, we can expect our entertainment to become increasingly specific to our tastes. I subscribe to The Economist and Foreign Affairs and I often receive subscription offers to periodicals like The New Yorker or Bloomberg. The periodicals I subscribe to are selling my information to entities that would like a heuristic for advertising to the public; I am a lead for the sales departments of publications everywhere whose readership overlaps with what I already subscribe to. I expect this type of profiling to bleed across mediums, and it probably already has. House of Cards is entertaining for me because it deals with the clandestine underbelly of international affairs, and anyone with a brain could ascertain that international affairs is an interest of mine.</p>

    <p>Over the years, between Heroes and Lost and The Office, discussions about TV have become more and more common in my social life. I lament this development. I failed to notice this encroachment occurring, but it is now marked when either I or my conversation partner make a point of mentioning a TV show. If I do it myself, I am periodically racked with self-loathing throughout the day, annoyed that I could not think of something meaningful or interesting to discuss. When the act is reversed and I am prodded about my TV habits, I subconsciously discount the other as I assume he wants to disuss TV because it is one of his primary leisure activities. A necessary component of any reversal to this conversational trend is a dramatic shift in how Americans spend their leisure time. I am pessimistic about this occurring.</p>

    <p>Our impulse of discussing TV belies a more general social norm touched upon by Mia in the film "Pulp Fiction":</p>

    <blockquote>Don't you hate that? Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?</blockquote>

    <p>Why indeed.</p>
