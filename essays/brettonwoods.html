	<p>You can see the words "Bretton Woods" used in a few ways. First off, it's a place in New Hampshire that contained (in 1944) a remote enough, pretty enough hotel to host a whopping 730 representative from all 44 Allied nations. Second, it hosted what is known as the Bretton Woods Conference. Its name on paper is the <span id="sparkle_left_1">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_2">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_3">*</span><span class="propaganda">United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference</span><span id="sparkle_left_3">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_2">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_1">*</span>, but outside of primary documents and contemporary press it's referred to simply as the Bretton Woods Conference. Even more important than the occurrence of the Conference were its effects. Nations' top monetary minds met nonstop for 3 weeks while drafting plans for a global financial order from which the US ultimately emerged supreme.</p>

	<p>One can surmise that the general mood of the world in July 1944 was likely rather dismal. After two World Wars, the Second even worse than the First, nations were likely to find international peace of the utmost importance. In an effort to root out the sources of armed conflicts, governments decided that economic woes stemming from monetary policy during the interwar period played a part. And they were a substantial enough contributor to warrant an effort to combat them. The introduction of a single reserve currency to help accomplish this isn't that exciting. But the choice of the US Dollar was. At Bretton Woods the USD asserted itself as the most important national currency in the world. In 2014, 60% of global foreign exchange reserves are made of it.</p>

	<p>In 1944, economic woes resulting from nationalist monetary policies popular after WW1 were bearing the blame for WW2. A particularly offensive practice was "currency warfare", or the purposeful manipulation of a currency's value. <p>

	<p>Write a paragraph about the fact that the Bretton Woods system has extremely clearn boundaries. Its origin was the Bretton Woods conference, which took place July 1-22, 1944 as the planet's most horrible war was concluding. And its end took place in 1971 with the Nixon Shock.</p>
