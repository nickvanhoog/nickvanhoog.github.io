	<p>The words "Bretton Woods" can refer to a few different things. It is the name of an area in Carroll, New Hampshire that is home to the Mt. Washington Hotel. The Hotel was remote enough and scenic enough to serve as the venue for a gathering of 730 representatives from all 44 Allied nations in the closing months of World War II. This conference, whose name on paper is the <span id="sparkle_left_1">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_2">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_3">*</span><span class="propaganda">United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference</span><span id="sparkle_left_3">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_2">*</span><span id="sparkle_left_1">*</span>, has come to be known simply as the Bretton Woods Conference. Although the Conference itself and the scale of participation is certainly interesting, its outcomes supercede it as historical subjects worthy of examination. The Conference's resulting agreements put into a place an internationally agreed-upon global monetary arrangement known as the Bretton Woods System. Although the System technically met its demise in 1971, its effects are still present in the global economy, and it serves as a case study in particularly overt monetary regulation and intervention.</p>

	<p>One can surmise that the general mood in July 1944 was rather dismal. After two World Wars, the Second even more horrific than the First, governments were likely to consider international peace a top policy priority. Prevailing opinion at the time considered economic woes stemming from nationalist monetary policies during the interwar period a chief contributor to tensions leading to the outbreak of war. TODO: Add examples of the interwar monetary policies and their effects here, how they helped contribute to war, etc. To maintain economic stability and prevent further armed conflicts, it was decided that the participating nations must all agree to maintain a certain degree of economic equilibrium between them.</p>
	
	<p>The US was doing OK for itself even before the Conference. <explain metrics that showed the US' awesome economy at the end of 1944, it didn't have fighting on its soil, it ramped up spending to pay for war stuff, high employment><but explain how TODAY USD economy is impressive, percent of GDP, GDP per capita compared to rest of world now as compared to in 1944><the roots of that course were planted in the Mount Washington Hotel that July></p>

	<p>The introduction of a single reserve currency to help accomplish this isn't that exciting. But the choice of the US Dollar was. At Bretton Woods the USD asserted itself as the most important national currency in the world. In 2014, 60% of global foreign exchange reserves are made of it.</p>

	<p>In 1944, economic woes resulting from nationalist monetary policies popular after WW1 were bearing the blame for WW2. A particularly offensive practice was "currency warfare", or the purposeful manipulation of a currency's value. </p>

	<p>Describe the undesired things that the Bretton Woods system was trying to counter.</p>

	<p>The parts of the BW system that were meant to counteract the previously mentioned undesired things.</p>

	<p>The system hinged on the USD being convertible to gold. Why did we pick the USD?</p>

	<p>Write a paragraph about the fact that the Bretton Woods system has extremely clearn boundaries. Its origin was the Bretton Woods conference, which took place July 1-22, 1944 as the planet's most horrible war was concluding. And its end took place in 1971 with the Nixon Shock.</p>
